Welcome to the Beta test for DXport!

DXport attempts to deal with the fact that
you cannot set the client port with DirectX
games. DirectX will use a port in the range
of 2302-2400, most of the time the port picked
is 2302. What DXport does is lock all the
ports outside of the range you specify. 

When DXport is started you will need to enter
in the ports you want your DirectX game to use.
The idea is to have all the clients use 
different ports. You can enter a single port or
a range of ports. Since MSN Messenger and other
Microsoft programs use this range of ports it
will usually be better to specify a range of
ports. After the examples I have a list of the
ports broken up into blocks of five.

Depending on the NAT hardware you are behind
this may be all that you have to do. Others 
will have to forward the ports on the NAT
device.  If you had to forward ports just to
play with one machine then this is probably
what you will have to do. If you have PC#1
using ports 2302-2306 on 192.168.1.10 then
forward those ports to that IP address and
do the same for each PC.   You will no longer
have all the ports (2302-2400) pointing to one
PC. Only forward the ports you setup on that
machine.

I would like to thank you for trying DXport
and I hope it will work for you. Feel free to
suggest ideas and add to this documentation.
Also, please send me a list of
any games you get this to work with.
